			<p>Enjoy traditional Italian cuisine at this classically styled restaurant. Just like the food Antica Pesa serves, there a few modern touches. Thereâ€™s a fireplace and modern light fixtures. The  vibe is comfortable and intimate. The dim lighting makes the restaurant more relaxed.

			<p>The Food at Antica Pesa can be described as traditional Italian cuisine with modern day touches. At this restaurant you can expect a refined meal. The meals also reflect rustic family recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. To start their meals off they serve a box of homemade breads and breadsticks. The bread and breadsticks were accompanied by different dipping sauces. Antica Pesa serves familiar foods like Parmigiana di Melanzane with their own twists. Thin almost chip-like slices of fried eggplant are elegantly layered with a ricotta and Parmesan mousse and served with juicy roasted cherry tomatoes and dots of rich basil pesto. Their beautifully made ravioli sat in a light artichoke sauce. The ravioli was filled with pecorino and parmesan cheese.

			<p>Get a taste of classic dinning Italian style without leaving Brooklyn. The service is just as amazing as the food. Water glasses are filled constantly and silverware is always replaced. Antica Pesa is open Monday through Sunday from 6 pm to 11:30 pm and Saturday and Sunday from 11:30 am to 3 pm for brunch. The restaurant is located on 115 berry street in Williamsburg.
