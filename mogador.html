				<p>In this city, restaurants come and go faster than you can say "sustainable locavore burger." And even though there are great new additions to the culinary landscape popping up every week, you've gotta give kudos to anyone who can stick it out for over a year. With that in mind, we bring you Still Got It, our tribute to establishments that continue to serve mouthwatering meals and drinks long after the buzz has faded—or if the lingering hype is still justified.
				</p>

				<p>New York's got so many brunch spots it's almost impossible to award any of them a first place title. But Cafe Mogador certainly is up there, serving up stellar Moroccan-inflected egg dishes at both its East Village eatery and Williamsburg outpost that are bound to keep you stuffed and sated the whole day long.
				</p>

				<p>The East Village Mogador, located on St. Marks, has been around since 1983, but underwent renovations in September, while the Williamsburg spot opened last March. Both spaces are charming, open and filled with Mediterranean artwork and inflections, and in warmer weather host sidewalk dining, though outdoor weekend eaters might find themselves plagued by the hoards of people waiting for a brunch table.
				</p>

				<p>Mogador only offers a handful of brunch dishes, and aside from the classic Mogador burger ($12-$13) served in the East Village, they're all egg-based. But the few dishes are divine: hearty, eggy, and flecked with Moroccan spice. The goat cheese, tomato and spinach omelette ($14) served in the East Village is plump with vegetables and zesty goat cheese, paired with potatoes sprinkled with za'atar spice and a few slices of sourdough bread. The Moroccan Benedict ($14 in the East Village, $15 in Williamsburg) is doused with spicy tomato sauce and poured delicately over a soft English muffin. And the Eggs Florentine (also $14 in EV, $15 in Williamsburg) sits on a bed of fresh spinach, drizzled with hollandaise sauce.
				</p>

				<p>All egg dishes come with a choice of organic fair trade espresso, a cappuccino or tea, along with a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. Mogador also serves a mean bloody mary ($7), though our favorite is the citrus-ey blood orange mimosa (also $7)—you can also get a regular mimosa for the same price. Brunch is served Saturdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., but be prepared to wait: we're not alone in lauding Mogador's meals.
				</p>

				<p>Cafe Mogador is 101 St. Marks Place (between First Avenue and Avenue A) in the East Village; 212-677-2226: and at 133 Wythe Avenue (between N. 7th and N. 8th Streets) in Williamsburg, Brooklyn; 718-486-9222
